## Coding Style used

This project adheres to JavaScript Standard for coding style. To maintain coding standards, utilizing features of ES6 and follow best development practices of react-native, this project also uses [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants), some rules of [eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/eslint-config), [import-resolver-typescript](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-import-resolver-typescript) and [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import).

**Do not disable lint inside the code. Try to understand the rule and then follow it into your code. Disabling lint will be considered a violation of coding standards. Exceptions will be allowed by the code-reviewer and team lead after understanding the need to ignore lint.**

1. **To Lint**

   Use the yarn script `lint`. To run it

```bash
  yarn lint
```

2. **Understanding Linting Errors**

   The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard. [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).
